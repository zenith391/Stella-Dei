Stella Dei is a sandbox game about creating planet and influencing it with your unlockable divine abilities in order to create and maintain life, civilizations, and maybe help them expand beyond.

> Careful. At some point youâ€™re just playing god.

It's also inspired by SimEarth.

## Compiling

### Dependencies

The game requires:

### Building from source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/PixelGuys/Stella-Dei && Stella-Dei
$ zig build
```

And now you've got an executable located inside `zig-out/bin/`. If you want to directly run the game, just do:
```sh
$ zig build run
```

To distribute an executable for Windows, use:
```sh
$ zig build -Dtarget=native-windows -Dcpu=x86_64_v2 -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
